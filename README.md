# Nightmare 
is built upon the shoulders of Electron, Node.js and Chromium. Previously it was using the headless browser PhantomJS which may have something to do with itâ€™s name.

# Electron
enables you to create desktop applications with pure JavaScript by providing a runtime with rich native (operating system) APIs.

## Install 
```
$ npm install
```

## Run
open chromium browser by __*Electron*__ engine, then run the test

```
$ node example

//or

$ node debug-example.js
```
